## PROJECT: Open Source HomeBrew Repeater Proctol Client/Master. ##

**UPDATES:**

**PURPOSE:** Thanks to the work of Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT we have an open protocol for internetworking DMR repeaters. Unfortunately, there's no generic client and/or master stacks. This project is to build an open-source, python-based implementation. This is a non-commercial license. Atribution is *required* if you use it.

For those who will ask: This is a piece of software that implements an open-source, amateur radio networking protocol. It is not a network. It is not indended to be a network. It is not intended to replace or circumvent a network. People do those things, code doesn't.
  
**PROPERTY:**  
This work represents the author's interpretation of the HomeBrew Repeater Protocol, based on the 2015-07-26 documents from DMRplus, "IPSC Protocol Specs for homebrew DMR repeater" as written by Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT, also licenced under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

**WARRANTY**
None. The owners of this work make absolutely no warranty, express or implied. Use this software at your own risk.

**PRE-REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE:**  
This document assumes the reader is familiar with Linux/UNIX, the Python programming language and DMR.  

**MORE DOCUMENTATION TO COME**
